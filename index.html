  <p>Engineer, sailor, and passionate about people management.
    I created a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6953721421168553984/"><strong>BRANCH</strong></a>
    of a German company, <a href="https://www.melk.gmbh/#lightbox_content376"><strong>MELK GmbH</strong></a>, in the city of
    <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/PVy231XijrPac5cV6"><em>Corrientes, Argentina</em></a> <br><br>
    Being the head of the branch, I dedicated myself to train the team in the technical tasks of the company,
    growing the company in less than two years from 1 employee to 10 people,
    with the acquisition of another 4 engineers before the end of the year 2022.
    I achieve a <em>900%</em> increase in staff in less than two years. <br> <br>
    During this stage, not only I trained them in the technical part,
    but using my skills as a <strong>COACH</strong>, I managed to select engineers,
    not only qualified for the tasks, but of excellent human material,
    managing to form a work team, in which the members shared inside and outside the office great moments.
    Creating strong bonds between them and helping them to achieve their goals,
    I managed to create a work environment in which we all wanted to be. <br> <br>
    And now, having built a totally independent work team, we have reached the peak,
    where the founder can retire, knowing that the team will grow with the tools I give them,
    I am looking for growth opportunities, learning the different programming languages,
    and waiting for the new challenges to come.
